# RESTAssured
###### RESTAssured is a Java library for testing RESTful web services.
###### RESTAssured uses Groovy under the hood, so JSON and XML can be handled dynamically.
###### The Jackson library can be used to handle JSON statically.

# Setup
###### Pay attention to the POM file. JUnit5 must be removed from the Java Build Path in Eclipse. Instead, add JUnit5 like in this POM XML.
