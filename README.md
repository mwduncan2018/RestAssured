# RestAssured
###### RestAssured is a Java library for testing RESTful web services.
###### RestAssured uses Groovy under the hood, so the JSON and XML can be handled dynamically.
###### RestAssured is a good choice to test a Web API, but the static typing of Jackson, Jackson Streaming API, and StAX are better when automating the testing of a data warehouse.

# Setup
###### Pay attention to the POM file. JUnit5 must be removed from the Java Build Path in Eclipse. Instead, add JUnit5 like in this POM XML.
